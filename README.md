VocabularyGame - Better your elocution
-----------------------------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple test game that accumulates points based on your correctly guessed choices. The question is on the top of the window and you must choose only one from five random choices to proceed to the next question.<br />Testing is the best approach to gain any knowledge and with this game it can't be easier.

####Installation
1. Download [dictionary.xlsm](dictionary.xlsm?raw=true) to some permanent location on your disk (like My Documents)
2. Download [VocabularyGame.msi](/VocabularyGame.msi?raw=true), install and run VocabularyGame from your desktop
3. When the open file dialog pops up, locate dictionary.xlsm
4. Enjoy, the game is started !

####Game Rules
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is simply played by choosing only one option from the five *Radio Buttons*. The choice you made should correspond to the question (the light-green text on the top of the window). If you choose correctly, you gain **+5 points**. But, if you are wrong, you **loose all your points** that you have accumulated so far. In meanwhile, if the *Countdown timer* is on and its time passes, then you loose **-15 points** instead of all of them.
 
When you click the sound icon (next to the question) you can hear and learn how to pronounce the phrase. These sounds are downloaded into the *sounds/* folder.
 
When you gain **30 points** for the first time, then you've made the first record. To break it again you must pass the best record made so far. To see all records go to *File -> Records*. The records are stored inside *dat/{dictionaryWithNoExt}_records.dat* file (i.e *dat/dictionary_records.dat*) and saved upon leaving the application.

####dictionary.xlsm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you open the application for the first, an open dialog pops out and asks you to locate *dictionary.xlsm*. This is a Macro-Enabled Excel file that contains all the unique entries, important for this game to choose from. You must have installed *Microsoft Office 2007* to edit this file.
